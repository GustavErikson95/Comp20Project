What does the business do and how does the website help them?
  One of the biggest struggles for plumbers is dealing with their wide network of clients that span long distances. Today, a 
  plumber would get a call to request for help, and can only determine the issue when they arrive at the clientâ€™s house. This 
  website seeks to ease the potential long distance a plumber must travel, and allows communication between plumber and client 
  in order to determine if a visit is necessary. Website is a platform to connect clients and plumbers so that plumbers can 
  figure out the problem without driving over, which maximizes efficiency. The website has an account system, so clients would 
  log in with a username.
